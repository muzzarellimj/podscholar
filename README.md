The `production-experiment` branch is an isolated environment to test the front-end HTML, CSS, and JS prior to 
implementing it into the Node environment in the production repository. This branch considers initial deployment 
modifications discussed in meetings that the `front-end` branch might not; e.g., the search bar (and related routes) 
is not present and the filter menu is lightweight in comparison with the final, ideal product.
